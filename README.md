# Vitamin

A very opinionated packaged boilerplate solution for using Vite, Vue 3, Inertia, Ziggy and Tailwind with Laravel.

Add to a new Laravel project using Composer:

```shell
composer require thepublicgood/vitamin
```

Once the package is installed, you can initialize with a new Laravel project with:

```shell
php ./artisan vitamin:init
```

Once installed, you can run a dev build server with `yarn dev` or build for production with `yarn prod`.
